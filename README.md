Here we hawe my home tasks on computer architecture course:
1) The operation of the processor cache was programmatically simulated in 3 versions: with the LRU eviction policy and bit-pLRU and RR.
2) A translator program (disassembler) has been written, with which you can convert machine code (extracted from an elf file) into program text in assembly language.
3) A program that allows you to perform arithmetic with fractional numbers in fixed-point and floating-point formats and program use only integer operations and data types.
4) Programm on cpp calculating the volume of a figure using the Monte Carlo method using openMP thread parallelization
